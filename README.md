A bookmarklet is a bookmark that executes javascript code to modify a webpage.  
  
# Usage
Drag the javascript file (.js) into a new bookmark.

Step By Step:  
1. Right click bookmarks bar
2. "Add Page"  
3. In the "name" section title it whatever you want
4. In the "URL" section, drag the javascript code into it
5. Click Save
6. Any time you want to use the bookmark, click the bookmark. REMEMBER: Bookmarks only work once per page instance, meaning if you refresh or open the page in a new tab, you will have to re-click the bookmark.
7. Follow instructions for how to use the bookmark/ what it does (generally the txt file in the same folder as the bookmark (.js file)).
